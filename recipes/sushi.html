<h2>Description!!</h2>
<p>Sushi rolls, also known as makizushi, are a popular Japanese dish made with sushi rice, nori seaweed sheets, and a variety of fillings such as fresh fish, vegetables, and other ingredients. They are one of the<strong>most recognizable and widely enjoyed</strong>  forms of sushi around the <em>world</em></p>

<h3>Steps </h3>

<ol>
    <li>Prepare the Sushi Rice:

        Rinse the sushi rice in a fine-mesh strainer until the water runs clear.
        Cook the rice according to the package instructions or using a rice cooker. Once cooked, let it cool slightly.
        While the rice is still warm, gently mix it with sushi vinegar. Use about 1 tablespoon of sushi vinegar per cup of uncooked rice. Be careful not to overmix and mash the rice. Let the rice cool completely to room temperature.</li>
    <li>Prepare the Fillings:

    Popular choices include fresh fish, avocado, cucumber, and cooked crab sticks.</li>
    <li>Set up the Rolling Station:

        Lay a bamboo sushi rolling mat (makisu) on a clean surface.
        Place a sheet of plastic wrap over the bamboo mat to prevent the rice from sticking to it.</li>
    <li>Assemble the Sushi Roll:

        Lay a sheet of nori, shiny side down, on the plastic wrap.
        
        Wet your hands to prevent the rice from sticking to them. Take a handful of sushi rice and spread it evenly over the nori, leaving about half an inch of nori uncovered at the top edge.</li>
